Papparazzi Config Files
=====================

Put these in the /conf directory of your paparazzi install. Look at the existing folder structure to see how. 

The two airframe files are for a fixed wing and a quad, both set up to use the STM32F4_Discovery board and its daughterboard with Drotek IMU. 

The Turnigy9XR radio file is set up for ppm use with the OrangeRX615 receiver.
